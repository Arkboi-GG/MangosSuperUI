/// === Why this is separate from M2Reader ===
///
/// <c>M2Reader</c> deliberately samples every colour / alpha / texture-weight / UV track down to one
/// rest value (<c>TryReadRestTrack</c>) and its stricter sibling <c>TryReadSupportedGlobalAnimation</c>
/// fails CLOSED on anything the vanilla M2 writer could not faithfully re-emit — a per-sequence
/// track, a hermite curve, a track with ranges. That policy is right for the forge: an import that
/// cannot round-trip a track must refuse it, and those failures are surfaced as import-fatal errors
/// through <c>RestColorErrors</c> / <c>TransparencyStaticAlphaErrors</c>.
///
/// A previewer wants the opposite policy. It is not re-emitting anything; it just has to move. A
/// hermite pulse it can only approximate linearly still reads as a pulse, and refusing it leaves the
/// user looking at a dead object. Sharing one extractor between the two would mean either weakening
/// the writer's guarantees or keeping the previewer blind, so this is a second, permissive reader
/// that touches nothing the forge depends on: it takes raw bytes and an already-parsed
/// <see cref="M2Model"/>, returns a manifest, and records no errors anywhere.
