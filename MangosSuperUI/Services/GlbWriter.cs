/// Uses SharpGLTF Toolkit (MeshBuilder + SceneBuilder) API.
///
/// Ported from MangosSuperUI_Extractor.GlbWriter — uses SkiaSharp instead
/// of System.Drawing for Linux (server-side) compatibility.
///
/// Each submesh becomes a separate mesh in the scene (like wow.export's "Geoset0", "Geoset1")
/// with its own material/texture. This prevents SharpGLTF from merging primitives that
/// share the same material.
///
/// Triangle winding: M2 indices are emitted in native order (i0, i1, i2) — no swap needed.
/// The Z-up → Y-up coordinate transform in M2Reader already flips handedness, so the
/// indices come out in glTF's expected counter-clockwise front-face convention as-is.
///
/// === Session M, then Session M-revert ===
/// Session M added "weapon mount-offset baking" — negating the weapon
/// M2's Attachment-0 position into the scene root translation, on the
/// theory that Attachment-0 in an item M2 is the hilt mount point.
///

/// The Attachment struct owns exactly one
/// (bone, position) pair (sourced from the CHARACTER M2's attachment
/// record) and weapons render with their vertices as-authored — the
/// M2 artist already placed the hilt at the model origin. The
/// weapon's own attachments are reserved for spell-visual EFFECT
/// mount-points (glow on enchanted weapons, Effect class with
/// itemVisualEffectId), not for geometry positioning.
///
/// Empirical confirmation of the offset error: for displayId 1542
/// (Sword_1H_Short_A_02.mdx), Session M placed the weapon mesh at
/// world (-0.285, 0.899, 0.476) while the hand bone was at world
/// (-0.059, 0.904, 0.476) — a (-0.226, -0.005, 0) push that turned
/// out to be exactly the M2's Attachment-0 position, the spot the
/// glow effect would mount, not the grip.
///
/// Revert behavior: scene root = Matrix4x4.Identity. The weapon's
/// vertex origin sits at whichever character bone the client mounts
/// it under (Attachment_1 = HandRight, Attachment_2 = HandLeft).
/// Visually awkward at character rest pose (no idle-pose rotation
/// on the hand → blade points along +X out of the hand instead of
/// down/back) but mechanically correct.
///
/// The "looks awkward" issue is a separate problem: vanilla WoW
/// applies an idle animation that rotates the hand bone so the
/// weapon sits naturally. Our character GLB ships in bind-pose with
/// identity rotations, so the hand is unrotated. Fixing it is an
/// idle-animation sampling problem, not a
/// GLB-writer problem.
///
/// === Cache impact ===
/// RigidGlbVersion bump invalidates the stale Session-M GLBs. The
/// CacheVersionRegistry sweep clears them; new requests regenerate
/// with identity transform. No code-side action beyond the version
/// bump.
