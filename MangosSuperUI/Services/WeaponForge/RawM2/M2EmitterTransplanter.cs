/// <summary>
/// Gives a forged v256 model a <b>real, moving</b> particle effect by transplanting one of Blizzard's
/// own emitters out of a stock 1.12 item model.
///
/// === Why a transplant and not an author ===
///
/// A vanilla particle-emitter record is 504 bytes, and it is NOT flat. It carries eleven
/// <c>M2Track</c> members (28 B each: <c>uint16 interp; int16 globalSequence;</c> then three
/// <c>M2Array{uint32 count; uint32 offsetIntoFile}</c> at +4/+12/+20) plus two filename arrays at
/// +24/+32 — 33 file offsets per record. Authoring one from scratch means inventing emission rate,
/// lifespan, gravity, drag, spin, particle type and every keyframe, none of which is guessable and
/// all of which the client will happily render as garbage. Lifting a working one instead means every
/// field except the four we deliberately change is Blizzard-authored and client-proven.
///
/// === The property that makes it safe (measured, do NOT re-derive) ===
///
/// Across <b>391 emitters on 130 stock 1.12 item models</b> (weapon/shield/shoulder/head), the
/// emitter block is <b>self-contained and terminal</b> in 391/391 cases:
///   • every non-empty M2Array inside a record points at or after <c>ofsParticleEmitters</c>;
///   • no other header array points into that region;
///   • the referenced data runs contiguously to EOF.
/// So <c>donor[ofsParticleEmitters .. EOF]</c> is a closed blob. Append it somewhere else, add a
/// constant delta to those 33 offsets per record, and the emitter is intact — no element sizes, no
/// per-track knowledge, no offset rebuild. That is the same offset-preserving-surgery discipline the
/// rest of RawM2 uses.
///
/// === Relationship to Services/M2Handlers (read this before adding a third one) ===
///
/// The project already had an M2 particle subsystem — <c>M2ParticlePatcher</c>,
/// <c>M2EmitterParser</c>, <c>M2TextureParser</c> in <c>Services/M2Handlers</c>, used by the Spell,
/// Item and Patch features. It does NOT overlap in function: those PATCH emitters (and texture
/// entries) that a model already has, which is what spell visuals need. This class ADDS an emitter to
/// a model that has none, which is what the Forge needs, because the vanilla weapon/armor donor
/// scaffolds ship with zero emitters. Nothing there can add one.
///
/// It does overlap in KNOWLEDGE, and the two derivations independently agree, which is worth keeping:
/// <c>M2EmitterParser</c>'s verified property offsets (emissionSpeed 0x048, speedVariation 0x064,
/// verticalRange 0x080, horizontalRange 0x09C, gravity 0x0B8, lifespan 0x0D4, emissionRate 0x0F0,
/// emissionAreaLength 0x10C) are exactly the <b>values array of each track</b> at
/// <see cref="TrackStarts"/> + 20 for the first eight tracks — 52+20=0x48, 80+20=0x64, 108+20=0x80,
/// 136+20=0x9C, 164+20=0xB8, 192+20=0xD4, 220+20=0xF0, 248+20=0x10C. Both descriptions also agree
/// that a track is 28 bytes; that file reads the leading <c>interp|globalSequence</c> pair as a single
/// <c>0x0000FFFF</c> marker and the empty ranges array as padding, which is the same bytes seen from
/// the other side. A change to either understanding should be reflected in both.
///
/// === What gets retargeted ===
///
/// Fixed-width, offset-free fields: position (+8, three WoW floats), bone (+20), texture index
/// (+22), the three colour keyframes (+336, BGRA each) and the three scale keyframes (+348) — where
/// the effect sits, what colour it is and how big.
///
/// Plus, when the source hands one over, the ten float TRACKS' <b>values in place</b>
/// (<see cref="Graft.Motion"/>). A track's value array is a separate run of floats addressed from the
/// record; overwriting the floats there changes nothing structural — same count, same offset, same
/// interpolation — so the offset-preserving-surgery discipline still holds, and the client is still
/// running Blizzard's own emitter code over Blizzard's own field layout.
///
/// That last part was originally left to the donor on the theory that the donor "keeps deciding how
/// it MOVES". Measured, that is the bug rather than the design: a donor authored for a thrown molotov
/// (FLAMELICKSMALL — lifespan 0.75 s, 7 particles/s, 4×4 flipbook) standing in for a Worldbreaker
/// shoulder brazier (lifespan 2.30 s, 8 particles/s, 1×1) drops the steady-state particle count from
/// ~18 to ~5 and steps a 16-cell flipbook 21 times a second, which reads as a fast on/off strobe
/// instead of fire. Position/colour/size were right and it still looked wrong. See
/// <see cref="M2EmitterMotion"/> for the measurement. The donor still decides everything that is not
/// a number on these ten tracks: flags, emitter type, particle type, blend, spin/tumble/wind, and the
/// tile grid that matches its own texture.
